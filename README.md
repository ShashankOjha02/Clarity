Clarity is an interactive smart glass that uses an Artificial Intelligence emotion detection system, to notify the user of the emotion that the users in front of them are feeling. This wearable gadget is also having regular smart glass abilities like; sending reminders, open schedules, and see the weather, to insure that all users get the best experience. 


## Problem:
As mental health continues make it a challenge for individuals to be integrated into the community, it is important that up and coming technologies also work to accommodate everyone. Specifically, studies have found the individuals with developmental disorders such as Autism and Asperger’s have trouble recognizing emotions, and fitting in. For this reason, we would like to introduce Clarity. Clarity is a smart glass allows for the user to detect the emotion that the individuals in their proximity are feeling, while still having the unique and powerful features of smart glasses including weather and showing daily routines and schedules. With more funding and development, the glasses can have so many more features to take accessibility away from your fingertips and into your eyes. 

## Misson Statment: 
We at clarity are determined to make everyone’s lives easier, specifically to help even the playing field for individuals with developmental disorders in recognizing how the society around them is interacting with one another.  
We as first time Makaton participants are determined to learn what it takes and make this project come in order to life and make an impact in as many lives as possible.  Throughout this Makathon, we have challenged our selves to deliver a well polished quality product that, we feel when brought to the market can really impact people’s lives. 

## About: 

### Market Scope:

  </p>
As the main point of this device is to help individuals with mental health disorders. However, the application on this device is limitless. Other integral market audiences to our device include:


  •	Educational Institutions can use clarity to help train children to learn about emotions and feelings at a young age. By being exposed to such a powerful technology to learn, students can be taught to share, and care by really being able to look at it from another person’s lenses. 
  
  •	Social Workers Interview Process can use our device to create a more dynamic and through process when it comes to determining the ideal person for a task. It can also be used by social workers and emotional intelligence researchers to have better studies and results. 
  
  •	With further development, this device can be used as a quick tool for     psychiatrists to analyse and understand their patients to a deeper level. By accessing individuals that need help at a faster level, more lives and be saved and improved.  
  
### Whats in it for you:

  </p>
 
The first stakeholder to benefit from Clarity is users. This product provides accessibility right to the eye of almost 75 million users: approx. number of individuals in the world with developmental disorders.  The emotion detection system, that the user’s disposable will make it easy to recognize the emotion that anyone, is feeling. Whether ones watching a Netflix show, or having a live casual conversation, Clarity has got you covered. 

Next, Qualcomm could have a significant partnership in the forthcoming of Clarity, as they would be an excellent distributor and partner. With professional machining and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor technology, the AI model is guaranteed to have high performance in a small package. 

Due to the various applications mentioned of this product, this product has exponential growth potential in the educational, research, and counselling industry, thus being able to offer significant potential in profit/possibilities for investors and researchers. 

## Technological Specifications

## Hardware:

### Refraction: 
Clarity uses two reflections to project the image from the screen to the eye of the wearer. The process can be seen in the figure below.  First, the light from the lcd screen bounces off the mirror which has a normal line oriented at 45 degrees relative to the viewer. Due to the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection relative to the normal line, the light rays first make a 90-degree turn. This results in a horizontal flip in the projected image. Then, in a similar fashion, this ray is reflected another 90 degrees against a transparent piece of polycarbonate plexiglass with anti reflective coating. This flips the image horizontally once again, resulting in a correctly oriented image. The total length that the light waves must travel should be equivalent to the straight-line distance required for an image to be discernible. This minimum distance is roughly 25cm for the average person.
