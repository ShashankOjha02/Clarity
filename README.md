Clarity is an interactive smart glass that uses an Artificial Intelligence emotion detection system, to notify the user of the emotion that the users in front of them are feeling. This wearable gadget is also having regular smart glass abilities like; sending reminders, open schedules, and see the weather, to insure that all users get the best experience. 


## Problem:
As mental health continues make it a challenge for individuals to be integrated into the community, it is important that up and coming technologies also work to accommodate everyone. Specifically, studies have found the individuals with developmental disorders such as Autism and Asperger’s have trouble recognizing emotions, and fitting in. For this reason, we would like to introduce Clarity. Clarity is a smart glass allows for the user to detect the emotion that the individuals in their proximity are feeling, while still having the unique and powerful features of smart glasses including weather and showing daily routines and schedules. With more funding and development, the glasses can have so many more features to take accessibility away from your fingertips and into your eyes. 

## Misson Statment: 
We at clarity are determined to make everyone’s lives easier, specifically to help even the playing field for individuals with developmental disorders in recognizing how the society around them is interacting with one another.  
We as first time Makaton participants are determined to learn what it takes and make this project come in order to life and make an impact in as many lives as possible.  Throughout this Makathon, we have challenged our selves to deliver a well polished quality product that, we feel when brought to the market can really impact people’s lives.
